# `tuicr/lib` — review-session tooling

Scripts backing the `tuicr` skill: opening a review window, keeping its refs
honest, and running the live-watch daemon that wakes an agent when the human
leaves a comment.

Every script is a **thin `.sh` wrapper** over a `.py` of the same name (cf.
`agent_inbox.py`). The `.sh` names are the stable entry points — `dev/SKILL.md`
and the test suites call them — so they never change. Shared primitives live in
[`../../_lib/skillkit`](../../_lib/README.md).

## Public contract

### `review.py [--repo D] [--session S] {list,comments,reply}`

The validated front door for the `tuicr review` operations agents perform.
Agents invoke tuicr free-hand from a shell, where two mistakes are easy to make
and hard to read from the resulting error:

- `--repo` is a **subcommand** flag, so `tuicr review --repo <path>` fails with
  `unexpected argument '--repo' found` and a usage block that never names the
  missing subcommand. Here the subcommand is required by the parser, and
  `--repo`/`--session` are accepted on **either side** of it — flag position
  cannot be got wrong because it does not matter.
- A reply threads **positionally**, so it only lands under the comment it
  answers when file, start line, end line and side all match. `reply --to
  <comment-id>` copies the parent's anchor verbatim instead of asking the
  caller to reproduce it, and echoes `ANCHOR=` so the result is verifiable.

`--session` defaults to the repo's active session. `comments --unanswered`
applies the pending rule (non-`reply`, no later reply at the same anchor).
`reply` rejects a body over 1500 chars — tuicr re-renders every comment each
frame, so total comment text drives the human's TUI latency.

Exits non-zero with a message naming the valid subcommands when one is omitted,
and lists the available comment ids when `--to` names an unknown one.

### `tuicr_up.py [directory]`

Launches tuicr in a new tmux window over a freshly-resolved revset, focuses it,
blocks until tuicr exits, then prints whatever tuicr exported.

Configured by environment, not flags: `TUICR_WINDOW_NAME` (default `tuicr`),
`TUICR_BASE_REF` (default: **the remote's own default branch**, never a
hardcoded name), `TUICR_HEAD_REF` (default `HEAD`), `TUICR_REMOTE` (default
`origin`).

Refuses (exit 1) when tuicr is missing, the target is not a git repo, or it is
not running inside tmux. Exits 0 without acting if a tuicr pane is already open
on that same checkout — scoped per-checkout so two repositories can be reviewed
at once.

### `refresh_review_refs.py [--repo D] [--base R] [--head R] [--remote R] [--no-ff]`

Fetches, resolves branch names to fresh remote-tracking refs, and fast-forwards
a clean `HEAD` that is behind its upstream.

Emits `REVIEW_BASE_REF`, `REVIEW_HEAD_REF`, `REVIEW_REVSET` as shell-`eval`-safe
`KEY=VALUE` lines.

| exit | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | unknown argument |
| 3 | repo missing, or not a git repository |
| 4 | remote does not exist |
| 5 | a ref does not resolve after the fetch |
| 6 | `HEAD` has diverged from its upstream |
| 7 | `HEAD` is behind but the worktree is dirty |
| 8 | the remote's default branch could not be determined |

Exits 6 and 7 are deliberate refusals: reviewing a stale `HEAD` shows the human
a diff that does not match the branch.

### `watch_up.py`

Daemon lifecycle for `tuicr-watch`. Generic — it knows nothing about any
workflow, so an orchestrator, a solo agent or a human drive it identically.

```
watch_up.py --repo D --session SLUG --cli-session UUID
            [--cli-pane P] [--name ID] [--persistent]
            [--ignore-type T]... [--rearm S] [--max-attempts N]
            [--event-timeout S] [--queue-timeout S] [--state-dir D]
watch_up.py --stop NAME | --stop-all [--prefix P] [--exclude S] | --list
```

Emits `WATCH_PID`, `WATCH_PIDFILE`, `WATCH_LOG`, `WATCH_NAME`,
`WATCH_PERSISTENT`. Starting is **idempotent**: a live PID in the pidfile is
reused and reported. Exit 2 for a missing required option, 3 for a missing
watcher/repo, 4 if the daemon died during startup.

`--name` lets a caller running several watchers retire exactly the one it means.
`--persistent` only *tags* the watcher so a bulk `--stop-all` can skip it.

### `tuicr_watch.py`

The daemon. Watches one session and wakes a Copilot CLI session when a comment
awaits a response. Run `--help` for the full option list; `--once --replay
--dry-run` tests detection without touching tmux or state.

## Design criteria

**The wake prompt is deliberately minimal.** It names the session and the
pending count and points at the skill's Wake contract — nothing else. Behaviour
lives in the skill, not the prompt, so it is identical whether the woken session
is a lone coding agent or an orchestrator brokering to sub-agents. The human's
comment text is never echoed back into the agent's input.

**Acceptance is proven from persisted events, never from the screen.** A wake
counts as delivered only once it appears in the session's `events.jsonl` as a
`user.message`. Terminal rendering is a diagnostic and can lie.

**Pane binding is re-checked before every injection.** If the agent exited and a
shell reclaimed the pane, pasting a prompt and pressing Enter would execute it
as a shell command. This is a safety check, not an optimisation, and an
ambiguous match is always an error — never a guess.

**A tuicr failure is never "no comments".** Conflating them would leave the
daemon reporting healthy while silently ignoring the human forever.

**But a permanent failure ends the watch.** Refusing to treat a read failure as
"no comments" must not mean waiting forever: a watcher whose review window had
been closed was observed logging 920 consecutive failures with no end. The two
cases are distinguished by `review list` — if it still answers but no longer
names the slug, tuicr is up and the session is genuinely gone, so the daemon
exits 0 with a reason. If `review list` fails too, tuicr itself is down, the
session's fate is unknown, and the daemon keeps waiting. The check only runs
after a ~60 s grace period and only while already failing, so restarting tuicr
never looks like the review ending and the poll loop is unaffected.

**Threading is positional.** tuicr comments carry no parent id; a reply attaches
to a comment only when `(path, start_line, end_line, side)` match exactly. The
daemon uses that same tuple to decide "answered", so a mis-anchored reply causes
the comment to stay pending and be re-delivered until its attempt budget is
spent. `skillkit.tuicrio.reply_to()` copies the parent's anchor to make that
class of bug unrepresentable.

**State is keyed by repo *and* slug.** Slugs are not unique across checkouts, so
hashing the slug alone would let two repositories share — and corrupt — one
ledger.

**Debounce before firing.** The pending set must be stable across two polls, so
a burst of comments produces one wake instead of one per comment.

## Performance note

The daemon polls, so process spawns in its hot loop are the only place execution
cost matters in this collection. The shell version spawned `python3` at 11 sites,
two of them *per iteration* of the submit-confirmation loop — about 68 ms of
overhead on a 100 ms step, inflating it to ~168 ms. All of those are now
in-process calls: the measured per-iteration overhead is 0.18 ms, so the poll
step is the step it claims to be.
